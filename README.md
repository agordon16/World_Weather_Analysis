# World_Weather_Analysis

## **Overview**
This project follows Jack, an analyst, as he helps to collect and present data for customers via a search page in which they will filter results based on preferred travel criteria. The search will take the criteria and utilize it to help the customer find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. Using visual and statistical analyses, along with linear regression on weather parameters in both hemispheres, the data will be able to help predict the best time of year to plan vacations.

Jack addresses the question of how to provide real time hotel suggestions based on a customer's definition of an "ideal" hotel by using weather analysis within a given range of latitudes and longitudes. These analyses are then presented in map format with multiple suggestions that include city, country, name of hotels, and current weather conditions.
